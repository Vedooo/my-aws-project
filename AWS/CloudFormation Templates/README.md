This file contains AWS CloudFormation template applications.

The VS Code interface and the YAML extension have been worked on, and VS Code Yaml tools have been used.

1. Cfn-EC2 => Basic EC2 creating with YAML and YAML VS Code tools

2. Cfn-EC2-SecGroup => Create an Instance with Security Group connection

3. Cfn-ASG-ELB-Template => Creating an Auto Scaling Group structure with ELB(Elastic Load Balance), ELB Listener, Target Group and Security Group. Parameters and Mapping value sets are also used for code organization.






You can access my tools here.
